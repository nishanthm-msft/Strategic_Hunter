# STRATEGIC HUNTER


### Summary

Strategic Hunter, a First-Person Perspective game is a crime thriller game where four desperate detectives unleash their detective skills to catch the most wanted criminal of the town who has escaped. 
The detectives are in different cities initially and they receive a high priority undercover operation orders from their Information Bureau to catch the most wanted criminal. 
The criminal is hiding in a city different from the detectives and the detectives need to travel through various cities and face a lot of hurdles during this operation. 
The detectives are initially provided with a default amount of Time remaining, Money, Health and a Pistol loaded with bullets. The detectives will get intel about the location of clues in their respective cities. 
There will be enemies from the criminal gang preventing the detectives from capturing the clue in each city. 
The detectives will get to know about their next city to travel only after capturing the clue by overcoming the hurdle in their current city. 
It takes detectives a considerable amount of Time, Health and Bullets in capturing the clues in each city. 
A detective has 3 options for his/her travel from one city to another after successful capturing of clues in their respective current cities. They are 
●	Hire a Cab
●	Train
●	Flight
where each mode of travel consumes its own amount of Time and Money. If in case 2 detectives end up in the same city at any point of their operation, 
they can continue as a team of 2 by paying the combining cost and only after mutual consent from both of them to form a team. Else they can continue their operation individually. 
A detective will not be able to travel further if he/she has exhausted the given Money. He/she cannot use the pistol to fight the enemies if he/she has exhausted the given bullets and will have to fight without the pistol further. 
So, he/she needs to plan his/her travel mode accordingly and use the bullets judicially during the entire operation. 
In case a detective is killed while capturing the clue, he/she will be respawn in the same city where he/she was killed. But a detective can only be respawned for a maximum of 3 times during the entire operation. 
A player/detective will be eliminated if
●	the respawning count exceeds 3
●	if he/she runs out of remaining time before catching the criminal
●	he/she has exhausted the given money before reaching the last city
The detective who catches the criminal first without getting eliminated with optimal/efficient use of available resources within the deadline is declared the winner.
